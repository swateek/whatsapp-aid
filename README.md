# WhatsApp Aid

Did you ever find it annoying to have to add a contact to be able to send a WhatsApp message? Be it for a delivery person or even a house help?

This is perhaps for you! You just need to specify the number in the text box and click on the button to open your WhatsApp without having to add the person to contact.
